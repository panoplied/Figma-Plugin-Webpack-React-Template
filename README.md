Webpack in this template actually works with React and inlines images into the bundle correctly unlike the one you can make by following step-by-step guide from the official Figma API doc manual.

Don't forget to update your `manifest.json` to change the name and id of your plugin.

Bundling set as usual in `package.json`.

Dev build:
```
npm run start
```

Production build:
```
npm run build
```
